PART I: Empirical Replication 

The empirical replication is in the folders cr_cps_data and cr_statistics. The folder cr_cps_data creates the raw CPS data, pulled from IPUMS for their sample period. Then, in the cr_statistics file, I replicate most of the figures and tables from the empirical section. I do not replicate the sections of Figure IV involving other datasets and Table I in the SCF. The figures and pieces of the table are in the output folder. I have also included the log file for further details, also in the output section. I can share the zipped dataset through dropbox, if needed,
